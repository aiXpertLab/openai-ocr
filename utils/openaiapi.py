    3. The type of data you might encounter in the invoice includes but is not limited to: hotel information, guest information, invoice information,
    room charges, taxes, and total charges etc. 

    4. If the page contains no charge data, please output an empty JSON object and don't make up any data.

    5. If there are blank data fields in the invoice, please include them as "null" values in the JSON object.
    
    6. If there are tables in the invoice, capture all of the rows and columns in the JSON object. 
    Even if a column is blank, include it as a key in the JSON object with a null value.
